# Battle.net launcher 

# How does it work?

The Battle.net launcher is a .exe that you download and it will then install the launcher for you. It's one of those setup executables that is small and it will download and install the up-to-date launcher for you. 

That means we just need to download the small .exe and execute it. Similar to [the steam-client package](https://github.com/mikecole/chocolatey-packages/tree/edf664202a8a5300106ec5f4671cd19b05164143/manual/steam-client). That means that it is manually updated.
